## Getting Started
_Why is youtube showing this set of videos on searching XYZ?_ <br>
_Which channel's most videos make it to the top search results?_ <br>
_How relevant are youtube search results for me?_  <br><br>

Obviously none except people at youtube tell how youtube search algorithm works but if you ever have searched on youtube **anonymously**, you might have noticed that by default the seach filter is set to **Relevance**. This project aims to analyse the top search results which a user may get upon searching anything on Youtube.com from a **non-personalized account**.

## Aim 
Considering that youtube algorithms work different for different people. (Sorry Kant!) We will analyse the top search results are selected from millions of videos on youtube. All the search results retrieved would be formatted and then respresented.
